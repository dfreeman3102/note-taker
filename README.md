# note-taker
Nineth bootcamp challenge, using what we have learned in class, with help from instructors, classmates, and outside research(YouTube tutorials,
stack overflow, etc.) to make a note-taker. It must open the note taker application and present a landing page. That landing page presents a button with a link to the notes page.
When on the notes page, you are presented with existing notes listed in the left hand column, and an empty field on the right to enter in a new note and title.
When a new note and title is added a save button and a clear button appears. When you click save that same note is added to the left hand column and can be accessed by clicking on
the title. When you click on new note, you are presented with empty fields again to restart the process.
